# Starter Code for CS162 HW2

Welcome to the coding part for the HW2! 

Example Commands:
```
python language_model.py --N 2 --k 0.1

python language_model.py --N 3 --backoff --lambdas 0.33 0.33 0.34 
```

Here, the arguments N is the order of the language model and k is the parameter for smoothing.

As part of the coding part of the homework, you need to complete all the TODO blocks divided into several tasks.

We provide a unit test code to help you debug. After you implement the TODO blocks, you can run
```
python test.py 
```

If successful, you will see outputs like
```
